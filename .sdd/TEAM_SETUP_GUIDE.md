## Integration with Local Commands

### Hybrid Approach

**Team Commands:**
- Standard SDD workflow
- Team-wide consistency
- Centralized management

**Local Commands:**
- Project-specific commands
- Personal preferences
- Experimental features

**Both Work Together:**
- Team commands appear first
- Local commands supplement
- No conflicts

### Priority Order

1. **Team Commands** - Standard workflow
2. **Local Commands** - Project-specific
3. **Built-in Commands** - Cursor defaults

## Migration from Local Commands

### If You Have Local Commands

**Option 1: Keep Both**
- Team commands for standard workflow
- Local commands for project-specific needs

**Option 2: Migrate to Team**
- Move local commands to dashboard
- Remove local files
- Use team commands only

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Core commands in team dashboard
- Project-specific locally
- Best of both worlds
