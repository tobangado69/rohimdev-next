# PLAN Mode Examples

This document demonstrates typical PLAN mode interactions for each SDD command, showing the plan-approve-execute workflow in action.

## Overview

Every SDD command now follows this pattern:
```
User Command → Analysis → Create Plan → User Approval → Execute → Document
```

These examples show what you can expect when using each command with PLAN mode enabled.

## Example 1: `/brief` - Feature Brief Creation

### Scenario
Creating a quick feature brief for user profile customization.

### User Command
```
/brief user-profile-custom Allow users to customize profile with avatar and bio
```

### AI Analysis Phase
```
Analyzing request...
- Checking existing user profile implementations
- Identifying requirements gaps
- Assessing if brief is appropriate complexity

Questions for you:
1. Should avatar support file upload or selection from library?
2. Are there character limits for bio text?
3. Should this include privacy settings?
```

### User Response
```
1. File upload only (jpg, png)
2. Yes, 500 character limit
3. No, privacy settings are separate feature
```

Questions:
1. Should we implement all notification types or start with email only?
2. Any specific tasks to prioritize?
```

### User Response
```
1. Start with email, then in-app notifications
2. Focus on backend first, frontend can wait
```

## Example 5: `/upgrade` - Escalating Complexity

### Scenario
Converting a brief to full SDD when complexity is discovered.

### User Command
```
/upgrade payment-integration Discovered PCI compliance requirements and need for multiple payment providers
```

### AI Analysis Phase
```
Analyzing upgrade trigger...
- Reading existing feature-brief.md
- Understanding compliance requirements
- Assessing new complexity level

Current brief covers:
- Basic payment processing
- Single provider (Stripe)
- Simple checkout flow

New requirements add:
- PCI compliance considerations
- Multi-provider support (Stripe + PayPal + Apple Pay)
- Payment method storage
- Refund/chargeback handling
- Compliance documentation

This complexity justifies full SDD 2.0 workflow.

Questions:
1. What compliance level needed? (SAQ A, SAQ A-EP, etc.)
2. Timeline for full implementation?
3. Team size (affects task breakdown)?
```

### User Response
```
1. SAQ A-EP (we'll handle card data temporarily)
2. 8-week implementation
3. 3 developers + 1 security consultant
```

## Key Takeaways

### PLAN Mode Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Visibility**: See what will be created before it happens
2. **Control**: Approve or modify plans before execution
3. **Quality**: More thoughtful, comprehensive planning
4. **Learning**: Understand AI reasoning and approach
5. **Safety**: No surprise file changes

### Tips from Examples

- **Be specific in commands**: More details = better plans
- **Answer clarifying questions**: Helps AI create better plans
- **Review plans carefully**: This is your chance to course-correct
- **Provide feedback**: Plans improve based on your input
- **Trust the process**: Plan-approve-execute ensures quality

### When Plans Need Adjustment

If a plan isn't quite right:
```
AI: "Here's my plan..."
You: "Close, but please also include X and change Y to Z"
AI: "Updated plan with your changes..."
```

The AI will revise and re-present until you're satisfied.
