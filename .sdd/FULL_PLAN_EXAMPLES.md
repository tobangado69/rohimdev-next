- Review and approve each task as it's created
- Understand each phase before moving forward
- Interactive, step-by-step learning about your project
- Best for: New projects, learning, thorough review

Option B: Immediate Execution
- Generate all tasks at once after roadmap approval
- Fast, automated task creation
- Quick setup for experienced users
- Best for: Well-understood projects, experienced teams

Which mode would you prefer? (A/B or 'one-by-one'/'immediate')
```

**User Response - One-by-One Mode:**
```
Option A - One-by-One
I want to learn about each phase as we go.
```

**User Response - Immediate Mode:**
```
Option B - Immediate

## Task Execution Flow

### Example: Executing a Research Task

```bash
# Step 1: Execute task
/execute-task task-001-1
```

**AI Response:**
```
Analyzing task task-001-1...

Task: Research Marketplace Patterns
Phase: research
Status: todo
Dependencies: ✅ All met

Plan for execution:
1. Run: /research task-001-1 "Research existing marketplace platforms"
2. Create: specs/active/task-001-1/research.md
3. Update: roadmap.json
4. Log: execution-log.md

Approve execution?
```

**User:** `Yes`

**AI Executes:**
```
Running /research task-001-1...

[Research phase with PLAN mode]
→ Creating research.md
→ Documenting patterns found
→ Adding recommendations

✅ Research complete!

Updated roadmap:
- task-001-1: todo → review
- linkedSpec: specs/active/task-001-1
- Column moved: todo → review

Next available: task-001-2 (ready to execute)
```

### Example: Executing with Dependencies

```bash
# Try to execute task with unmet dependency
/execute-task task-002-1
```

**AI Response:**
```
❌ Cannot execute task-002-1

Reason: Dependency not met
- Depends on: task-001-3 (status: in-progress)

Recommendation:
1. Complete task-001-3 first
2. Or check if task-001-3 is actually done and update status

Available tasks:
- task-001-2 (no dependencies)
- task-001-4 (no dependencies)
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### 0. Choosing Execution Mode

**Choose One-by-One when:**
- ✅ Learning about your project structure
- ✅ Want to understand each phase before it's created
- ✅ Need to adjust approach as you learn
- ✅ First time using full planning
- ✅ Complex or unfamiliar project domain

**Choose Immediate when:**
- ✅ Well-understood project
- ✅ Experienced with SDD workflow
- ✅ Need fast setup
- ✅ Ready to collaborate with team
- ✅ Want complete roadmap immediately

**Remember:** You can switch modes mid-process if needed!

### 1. Choosing the Right Complexity

**Use Simple** when:
- Single feature addition
- 1-2 week timeline
- 1-2 developers
- Well-understood domain
- Example: Add export feature

**Use Medium** when:
- Full application
- 4-8 week timeline
- 3-5 developers
- Some unknowns
- Example: Blog platform

**Use Complex** when:
- Platform/system
- 10+ week timeline
- 6+ developers
- Many unknowns
- Compliance requirements
- Example: Marketplace

### 2. Task Granularity

**Good task size:** 4-16 hours (0.5-2 days)
**Too small:** 1-2 hours (creates overhead)
**Too large:** 40+ hours (hard to track)

**Example - Good:**
```
- Implement user authentication (16h)
  ├── Set up auth service (8h)
  └── Create login/signup UI (8h)
```

**Example - Too granular:**
```
- Create login button (1h)
- Add click handler (1h)
- Style button (1h)
```

### 3. Dependency Management

**Clear dependencies:**
```json
{
  "task-003": {
    "dependencies": ["task-001", "task-002"],
    "description": "Depends on auth (task-001) and database (task-002)"
  }
}
```

**Avoid circular:**
```json
// ❌ BAD
{
  "task-A": {"dependencies": ["task-B"]},
  "task-B": {"dependencies": ["task-A"]}
}
```

### 4. Using SDD Commands Effectively

**Research phase:**
- Use for new domains
- Pattern discovery
- Technology evaluation

**Brief phase:**
- Quick features
- Well-understood scope
- Rapid iteration

**Full SDD:**
- Complex features
- Compliance requirements
- Multi-team coordination

### 5. Progress Tracking

**Update regularly:**
```bash
# Mark task complete
/execute-task task-001-1
# System updates status automatically

# Track hours
# Update actualHours in roadmap.json

# Log blockers
# Add to task.blockers array
```

### 6. Team Collaboration

**Assign tasks:**
```json
{
  "task-001": {
    "assignee": "developer-1",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

**Track comments:**
```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "author": "developer-2",
      "content": "Need clarification on API structure",
      "created": "2025-10-21T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Integration with VSCode Extensions

### Future Extension Features

**Phase 1: Read-Only View**
```typescript
// Display kanban board from roadmap.json
showKanbanBoard(projectId);
```

**Phase 2: Interactive**
```typescript
// Drag task between columns
moveTask(taskId, fromColumn, toColumn);

// Execute task via UI
executeTaskFromUI(taskId);
```

**Phase 3: Real-Time**
```typescript
// Sync changes across team
syncRoadmapChanges();
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Addition to Existing App

```bash
/sdd-full-plan feature-name Brief description
→ Simple complexity
→ 1-2 epics
→ Brief approach
```

### Pattern 2: New Application

```bash
/pecut-all-in-one app-name Comprehensive description with key features
→ Medium complexity
→ 4-8 epics
→ Mixed SDD approach
```

### Pattern 3: Platform/System

```bash
/sdd-full-plan platform-name Detailed description with integrations and compliance
→ Complex complexity
→ 10+ epics
→ Full Planning workflow
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try your first roadmap:**
   ```bash
   /sdd-full-plan test-project Simple test of full planning feature
   ```
