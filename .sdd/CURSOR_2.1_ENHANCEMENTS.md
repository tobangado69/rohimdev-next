# Cursor 2.1 Enhancements for SDD

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Cursor Version:** 2.1+  
**Status:** Archived (superseded by SDD 5.0)

---

## Overview

This document details how Cursor 2.1 features enhance the SDD (Spec-Driven Development) system, providing better user experience, faster workflows, and improved code quality.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Improved Plan Mode with Interactive UI ✅

**What Changed:**
Cursor now shows an interactive UI for answering clarifying questions during plan creation.

**SDD Integration:**

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Faster question answering
- 🎯 Better question visibility
- 📱 Improved mobile/tablet experience
- 🎨 Better UX overall

**Usage:**
When running any SDD command, if questions are needed, they'll appear in an interactive UI. Simply click or type your answer directly.

**Example:**
```
/brief user-notifications Add notifications feature

AI: [Shows interactive question UI]
    "What types of notifications? (Email, Push, In-App)"
    
User: [Clicks "Email and Push" in UI]

AI: [Continues with next question or creates plan]
```

---

### 2. Search Within Plans (⌘+F) ✅

**What Changed:**
You can now search inside generated plans using ⌘+F (Cmd+F on Mac, Ctrl+F on Windows/Linux).

**SDD Integration:**
- All generated plans are searchable
- Quickly find specific sections
- Navigate large plans efficiently
- Search for keywords, file paths, or section names

**Benefits:**
- 🔍 Fast navigation in large plans
- 📋 Easy to find specific information
- ⏱️ Saves time reviewing plans
- 📖 Better plan readability

**Usage:**
1. Generate a plan with any SDD command
2. Press ⌘+F (or Ctrl+F)
3. Type what you're looking for
4. Navigate through matches

**Pro Tips:**
- Search for "What will be created" to see file changes
- Search for file paths to find specific files
- Search for keywords like "dependencies" or "risks"
- Use regex patterns for advanced searches

**Example:**
```
/specify blog-platform Full blog with CMS

[Plan generated - 200+ lines]

⌘+F → Type "database" → Find all database-related sections
⌘+F → Type "specs/active" → Find all file paths
⌘+F → Type "dependencies" → Find dependency information
```

4. Get notification when plan ready
5. Review plan when convenient

**Example:**
```
/sdd-full-plan ecommerce-platform Multi-vendor marketplace

[Enable background planning]

AI: Plan generation started in background...
    You'll be notified when complete.
    
[Continue working on other tasks]

[Notification appears]
AI: ✅ Plan ready! Review when convenient.
```

**Parallel Planning:**
- Create multiple plan options
- Compare different approaches
- Choose best plan for your needs
- Useful for complex, uncertain projects

- No file conflicts (isolated environments)
- Better team collaboration

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ 8x faster for independent tasks
- 👥 Better team utilization
- 🔒 No conflicts (isolated environments)
- 📊 Parallel work streams

**Usage:**
Execute multiple independent tasks from roadmap:

```bash
# Execute 3 independent tasks in parallel
/execute-task task-001  # Agent 1 - Research
/execute-task task-002  # Agent 2 - Specification
/execute-task task-003  # Agent 3 - Planning
```

**When to Use:**
- Tasks have no dependencies
- Multiple developers available
- Want faster completion
- Independent work streams

**Safety:**
- Each agent has isolated copy (git worktree or remote)
- No file conflicts possible
- Merge results when complete
- Track progress independently

**Example:**
```
Roadmap has 5 independent tasks ready:

/execute-task task-001  # Agent 1 starts
/execute-task task-002  # Agent 2 starts
/execute-task task-003  # Agent 3 starts
/execute-task task-004  # Agent 4 starts
/execute-task task-005  # Agent 5 starts

[All 5 tasks execute in parallel]
[Each in isolated environment]
[No conflicts]
[Faster completion]
```
