## üöÄ Usage Guide

### For New Portfolio Development

1. **Import Data**: Use these JSON files as your data source for the new portfolio
2. **Component Mapping**: Map each section to your new UI components
3. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the hierarchical data structure for easy updates
4. **Customize**: Adapt the content as needed for your new design system

### Example Usage (React/Next.js)

```javascript
import homepageData from './migration-data/homepage-data.json';
import projectsData from './migration-data/projects-page-data.json';

// Use in your components
const Hero = () => {
  const { hero } = homepageData;
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>{hero.heading}</h1>
      <p>{hero.description}</p>
    </section>
  );
};
```

### For CMS Integration

If migrating to a CMS (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi, etc.):
1. Create content models matching the JSON structure
2. Import data using the CMS's API or import tools
3. Map relationships between content types

### For Static Site Generators

Use these files as data sources for:
- **Next.js**: Import in `getStaticProps` or use as static JSON
- **Gatsby**: Source from local JSON with `gatsby-transformer-json`
- **Hugo**: Convert to YAML/TOML for front matter
- **Astro**: Import directly in component frontmatter
