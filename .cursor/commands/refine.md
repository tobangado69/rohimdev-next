## Role

**Refinement facilitator** - Help users iterate on existing documentation through conversational exploration, making targeted improvements. Find existing specs/briefs, understand refinement goals, explore improvements through discussion, and make targeted updates while preserving original context.

## Usage

```
/refine [task-id]
```

**Examples:**
```
/refine user-auth
/refine checkout-flow
/refine notification-system
```

---

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Analysis (Readonly)

**Step 1: Find refinement targets**

Search for:
1. `specs/active/[task-id]/feature-brief.md`
2. `specs/active/[task-id]/spec.md`
3. `specs/active/[task-id]/plan.md`
4. `specs/active/[task-id]/tasks.md`

**Step 2: Present what's available**

```
## Refinement Targets Found

**Task:** [task-id]

**Available documents:**
| # | Document | Last Updated | Size |
|---|----------|--------------|------|
| 1 | feature-brief.md | [date] | [lines] |
| 2 | spec.md | [date] | [lines] |
| 3 | plan.md | [date] | [lines] |

**What would you like to refine?**
1. Feature brief - Requirements and approach
2. Specification - User stories and acceptance criteria
3. Technical plan - Architecture and design
4. Something specific - Tell me what

(Or just tell me what you want to change, and I'll find the right document)
```

**Step 3: Load the target document**

Once user indicates what to refine:
- Read the full document
- Summarize current state
- Identify sections

### Phase 2: Exploration (Conversation)

**Start the refinement conversation:**

```
## Current State: [Document Name]

**Summary of what's documented:**
[Brief summary of key points]

**Sections:**
1. [Section 1] - [Brief description]
2. [Section 2] - [Brief description]
3. [Section 3] - [Brief description]

**What would you like to refine?**

Some options:
- Add new requirements
- Clarify existing requirements
- Change the technical approach
- Update scope (add/remove items)
- Modify success criteria
- Something else

Tell me what you're thinking, and we'll work through it together.
```

**Conduct conversational refinement:**

Ask follow-up questions:
- "When you say [X], do you mean [A] or [B]?"
- "How does this affect [existing requirement]?"
- "Should this replace [old approach] or be in addition to it?"

**Track refinement requests:**
```
**Refinement requests so far:**
1. [CHANGE] Modify requirement X to include Y
2. [ADD] New requirement for Z
3. [REMOVE] Take W out of scope
4. [CLARIFY] Make section Q more specific

Anything else to refine before I apply changes?
```

### Phase 3: Planning (Show Changes)

**Present proposed changes before applying:**

```
## Proposed Refinements

**Document:** `specs/active/[task-id]/[file]`

### Change 1: [Title]
**Type:** [ADD/MODIFY/REMOVE/CLARIFY]

**Before:**
```
[Current content]
```

**After:**
```
[Proposed content]
```

**Reason:** [Why this change]

**Summary of changes:**
- [ADD] [Count] new items
- [MODIFY] [Count] existing items
- [REMOVE] [Count] items
- [CLARIFY] [Count] items

**Changelog entry:**
| [version] | [date] | [summary] | Refined |

Ready to apply these changes?
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Phase 4: Execution (After Approval)

**Step 1: Apply changes**

Update the document with:
- All approved changes
- Change labels in comments if helpful
- Updated version number
- Updated timestamp

**Step 2: Add changelog entry**

```markdown
## Changelog

| Version | Date | Changes | Author |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 1.2 | [date] | [REFINED] [summary of changes] | System |
| 1.1 | [date] | Previous changes | System |
| 1.0 | [date] | Initial | System |
```

**Step 3: Verify changes**

Read the file back to confirm updates applied.

### Phase 5: Completion

**CHECKPOINT: Refinement Complete (REQUIRED)**

Before final output, verify:
- [ ] All requested changes applied
- [ ] Original context preserved
- [ ] Changelog updated

- [ADD] [Count] new items
- [MODIFY] [Count] existing items  
- [REMOVE] [Count] items
- [CLARIFY] [Count] items

**Version:** [old] → [new]

## Change Labels

Use these labels to track changes:

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `[ADD]` | New content | New requirement added |
| `[MODIFY]` | Changed content | Requirement wording updated |
| `[REMOVE]` | Deleted content | Feature moved to out-of-scope |
| `[CLARIFY]` | Made clearer | Added specific acceptance criteria |
| `[MOVE]` | Relocated content | Moved from must-have to nice-to-have |

## Refinement Patterns

### Adding New Requirements

```
User: "We also need email notifications"

Response:
"I'll add email notifications as a new requirement.

Should this be:
A) Must-have for v1
B) Nice-to-have for v1
C) Planned for v2

And what triggers the notification?"
```

### Modifying Existing

```
User: "Change the auth to use OAuth instead of JWT"

Response:
"I'll update the authentication approach.

Current: JWT-based authentication
Proposed: OAuth-based authentication

This affects:
- Technical approach section
- Security considerations
- Possibly the task breakdown

Should I update all related sections?"
```

### Removing/Descoping

```
User: "Remove the admin dashboard from v1"

Response:
"I'll move admin dashboard to out-of-scope for v1.

I'll add it to:
- Out of Scope section (with reason: 'Deferred to v2')
- Nice-to-have or Future section

This also removes related tasks. Confirm?"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User wants to refine multiple documents
**Cause**: Changes affect brief, spec, and plan
**Solution**: Prioritize:
- "These changes affect multiple documents. Let's start with [spec.md] and then update related docs."

### Issue: Refinement contradicts existing content
**Cause**: New request conflicts with previous decision
**Solution**: Highlight and confirm:
- "This contradicts [existing decision]. Should I update both, or keep the original?"

### Issue: Changes are too extensive
**Cause**: User wants major overhaul
**Solution**: Suggest alternative:
- "These changes are significant. Would `/upgrade` or creating a new brief be better?"
