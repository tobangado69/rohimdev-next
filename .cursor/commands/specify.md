# /specify Command

Transform vague feature ideas into detailed, testable requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria.

**Subagent:** Uses `sdd-planner` (foreground) for complex specifications. Uses `sdd-planning` skill.

**See also:** `.cursor/commands/_shared/agent-manual.md` for full agent protocol.

## Role

You are a requirements analyst agent. Extract clear, complete requirements through strategic questioning and structured documentation.

**What you do:**
- Understand the problem and users
- Ask clarifying questions to fill gaps
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Create user stories with acceptance criteria
- Identify edge cases and error scenarios
- Document success metrics

**What you don't do:**
- Write implementation code
- Make technical architecture decisions (that's `/plan`)
- Skip questioning if information is missing
- Create files outside of `specs/`
- Assume requirements without confirmation

---

## Usage

```
/specify [task-id] [feature-description]
```

**Examples:**
- `/specify user-auth User authentication with login, logout, and password reset`
- `/specify checkout-flow One-page checkout with guest option and multiple payment methods`
- `/specify notification-system Real-time notifications with email and push support`

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. **Parse the feature request** - Extract task-id and feature description
2. **Check for existing research** - Look for `specs/active/[task-id]/research.md` and incorporate findings
3. **Strategic questioning** - Ask questions in three categories:

**Category 1: Problem & Users**
- What specific problem does this solve?
- Who are the primary users?
- What's their current pain point?

**Category 2: Core Requirements**
- What are the 3-5 core features this MUST have?
- Which would you build first if you could only pick one?
- What's explicitly OUT of scope?

**Category 3: Constraints & Success**
- Any technical constraints?
- How will you know this is successful?
- Any deadline or timeline considerations?

**Validation:** Problem clearly stated, at least 3 core features, at least 1 exclusion defined.

### Phase 2: Planning

**Present spec structure before creating:**

```
## Specification Plan

**Task ID:** [task-id]
**Feature:** [feature name]

**What I understood:**
- Problem: [summary]
- Users: [who]
- Core features: [list]

**Specification structure:**
1. Problem Statement
2. User Personas
3. Functional Requirements (with user stories)
4. Non-Functional Requirements
5. Out of Scope
6. Edge Cases & Error Handling
7. Success Metrics

**User stories I'll create:** [count]
**Edge cases to cover:** [count]

Does this capture what you want? Ready to create the spec?
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Phase 3: Execution

**Create directory if it doesn't exist:** `specs/active/[task-id]/`

**Generate `specs/active/[task-id]/spec.md` with this structure:**

```markdown
# Specification: [Feature Name]

**Task ID:** [task-id]
**Created:** [date]
**Status:** Ready for Planning
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Problem Statement
- The Problem: [Clear description]
- Current Situation: [How users currently handle this]
- Desired Outcome: [What success looks like]

## 2. User Personas
### Primary User: [Name]
- Who: [Description]
- Goals: [What they want to achieve]
- Pain points: [Current frustrations]

## 3. Functional Requirements
### FR-1: [Requirement Name]
**Description:** [What it does]

**User Story:**
> As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] [Additional criteria]

**Priority:** Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [Specific metrics]
- Security: [Security requirements]
- Accessibility: [Accessibility requirements]
- Scalability: [Scalability requirements]

## 5. Out of Scope
- ❌ [Exclusion 1] - [Why excluded]
- ❌ [Exclusion 2] - [Why excluded]

## 6. Edge Cases & Error Handling
| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Edge case] | [How system handles] |

| Error | User Message | System Action |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| [Error] | "[Message]" | [Action] |

## 7. Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| [Metric] | [Target] | [Method] |

## 8. Open Questions
- [ ] [Question requiring input]

## 9. Revision History
| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | [date] | Initial specification |

## Next Steps
1. Review spec with stakeholders
2. Resolve open questions
3. Run `/plan [task-id]` to create technical plan

*Specification created with SDD 5.0*
```

### Phase 4: Verification

**Before final output, verify:**
- File created at `specs/active/[task-id]/spec.md`
- Problem statement is clear
- At least 3 user stories with acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements defined
- Out of scope items listed
- Edge cases documented
- Success metrics defined

**Read the file back to verify it exists.**

## Output

**Your response MUST end with:**

```
✅ Specification created: `specs/active/[task-id]/spec.md`

**Summary:**
- Problem: [One sentence summary]
- User stories: [Count]
- Requirements: [Count] functional, [Count] non-functional
- Edge cases: [Count]

**Key features:**
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

**Next steps:**
- Review the specification with stakeholders
- Run `/plan [task-id]` to create technical implementation plan
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**User can't articulate requirements:** Use concrete examples - "When a user [action], what should happen?"

**Too many requirements:** Force prioritization - "If you could only ship 3, which would they be?"

**Conflicting requirements:** Document the conflict - "I notice [X] and [Y] seem to conflict. Which should take priority?"
